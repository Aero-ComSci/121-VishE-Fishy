The change color method changes the color of the turtle temporarily. First, it randomly selects a color from the colors list and applies it to the turtle using the fillcolor method. Then, it stamps the turtle on the screen to leave a mark in that color. After stamping, the turtle’s color is reset back to its original color, stored in spot color. This method allows for dynamic visual changes during the game, adding excitement and interaction for the player while keeping the turtle's base color consistent after each click.

The sizechange method is designed to change the size of the turtle object self.t each time it is called. It does this by using the shapesize method, which modifies the size of the turtle based on specified parameters. The method randomly selects a size from the sizes list, which contains different size options. The rand.choice(self.sizes) function picks one of these sizes at random, allowing the turtle to appear in various sizes during the game. This feature adds an element of unpredictability and fun for the player, as the turtle changes size whenever it is clicked.
